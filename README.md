***Ultra-Marathon Running Analysis (2020 - 50mi and 50km Races in the USA)***

This project analyzes ultra-marathon race data from 2020, specifically focusing on 50-mile and 50-kilometer races in the USA. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, was cleaned and processed to create a subset for the selected races.

The analysis includes:

-Exploratory data analysis and visualizations

-Comparison of the popularity of 50mi vs 50km races

-Investigation of athletes' average speeds for both races, broken down by gender

-Analysis of the best and worst age groups in the 50mi race

-Examination of average speeds across different seasons for both race distances

Key findings include the greater popularity of 50km races and insights into how different factors (gender, age, season) influence athletes' performance.
